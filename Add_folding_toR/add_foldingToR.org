This is a small script to add ~#~ to .R files
 so that they can be folded in RStudio.

* Code
#+begin_src python :tangle yes
  import sys

  def add_folding(rfile):
      with open(rfile, "r+") as infile:
          for line in infile:
              if line.startswith("##"):
                  print("##"+line.strip()+" ####")
              else:
                  print(line.strip())

  if __name__ == "__main__":
          filename = sys.argv[1]
          add_folding(filename)
#+end_src
